# Whitaker's Words

The WORDS program parses Latin text into its forms. It can also provide suggestions for Latin words based on an English input.

This project uses Express to create a server to create an API for the WORDS program using Notre Dame University's online WORDS program (see `app.js`). Try [this query](https://whitakers.herokuapp.com/api/latin/salve).

The server also sends a site (see `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/index.js`) to use the API. Visit [whitakers.herokuapp.com](https://whitakers.herokuapp.com/).
