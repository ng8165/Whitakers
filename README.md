# Whitaker's Words

The WORDS program parses Latin text into its forms. It can also provide suggestions for Latin words based on an English input.

This program uses Notre Dame University's online host of the WORDS program to create an API for the WORDS program (see `app.js`). Try [this query](https://whitakers.herokuapp.com/api/latin/salve).

There is also a front-end website (see `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/index.js`) which has a form to receive input and post the result of the API call. Visit [whitakers.herokuapp.com](https://whitakers.herokuapp.com/).
