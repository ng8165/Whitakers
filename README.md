# Whitaker's Words

The WORDS program parses Latin text into its forms. It can also provide suggestions for Latin words based on an English input.

This project uses Next.js to create a server to create an API for the WORDS program using Notre Dame University's online WORDS program  (see `pages/api/[mode]/[word].js`). Try [this query](https://whitakers.vercel.app/api/latin/salve).

Next.js also serves a site (see `pages/index.js` and `css/styles.css`) to use the API. Visit [whitakers.herokuapp.com](https://whitakers.vercel.app/).
